# Microtask-Labor-S&DS-492-Project

## Abstract
Microtask labor, the process of completing small tasks via digital platforms for minimal pay, has rapidly expanded in recent years. Microtask workers contribute to AI development by providing data for machine learning models through tasks such as image labeling and text transcription. Despite their crucial role, the human geography of this invisible population of workers remains largely unexplored, with limited understanding of its distribution and the factors that influence it. Here, using web traffic data and macroeconomic data, we show that COVID cases, GDP, and population are significant predictors of microtask labor traffic in a linear model. Our findings reveal a greater understanding of the geographies of microtask clients and workers, as well as the criteria that make certain countries targets for microtask platforms. This study contributes to the broader discourse on the invisible gig economy, providing insights into the factors shaping the landscape of microtask labor and its implications for the future of work.
